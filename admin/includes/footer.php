              <h4><b>Your privacy is important to us, and so is being transparent about how we collect, use, and share information about you. This policy is intended to help you understand:</b></h4>
              <p>
              A. Universal Confidentiality features: <br>
                <b>Profile Design</b><br>
                Our profile format is designed so as to prevent people from identifying you unless you wish them to do so. Thus the information that is gathered is general in nature - age, height, gender, caste, ethnicity, occupation, location, family profile, interests, desired partner profile etc. Typically information that will help generate interest among the right prospective life partners without individually identifying you. Uploading photographs is optional. <br><br>

              B. Protect your confidentiality: <br>
                At madeinheaven.com we understand that different people have different needs for privacy and confidentiality. Thus For this reason we empower our registrants with tools to customize the privacy levels of their profile, photographs and contacts. <br>
                Some of these settings are : <br><br>

                <b>1) For Profile: -</b> <br>

                1. Allow my detailed profile to be viewed by all visitors or <br>
                2. Allow my detailed profile to be viewed only by registered users who pass my filters. <br><br>
                Profile visibility settings are available in the settings section which is accessible from the header and footer on all pages after login. We recommend that you go in for the first privacy setting as that will get you the maximum response. Frequently our site is searched by casual browsers who are highly qualified, eligible people or friends and relatives of a prospective bride or groom and thus your profile is visible to this important group of visitors. <br><br>

                <b>2) For Photograph:-</b> <br>

                In case you wish to upload your photograph(s) along with your profile then you have the following options : - <br>

                1. I want my photos to be visible to all members. <br>
                2. I want my photos to be visible only to members I contact and to members I accept. <br><br>
                Thus you get to set that privacy level for your photograph which you feel most comfortable with. We would however recommend that you do upload your photographs and go in for the first privacy setting option as that is likely to get you the maximum relevant response. The photograph privacy settings options are available in the 'My Photos' section of the 'My Profile' page. This page can be accessed after you have registered your profile.
